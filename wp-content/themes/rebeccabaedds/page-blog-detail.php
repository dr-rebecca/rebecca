                        <h4 class="text-t">I’m missing a tooth. What are my tooth replacement options?</h4>
                        <p class="blog__post">
                            There are several options to replace missing teeth. One available option is to place a fixed
                            bridge. Many dentists agree that dental care should be approached from a tooth-conserving
                            perspective and placing a fixed bridge usually requires altering teeth that are otherwise
                            healthy. In order to preserve your all of your teeth, and to provide a solution that is
                            natural-looking, dentists offer dental implants as a better, longer lasting less invasive
                            solution.

                        <p class="blog__post">
                            Dental implants serve as a complete tooth replacement. They are usually broken down into
                            three
                            components: the post, abutment, and restoration. <br>
                            <br>
                            The dental implant post looks like a screw. It is normally made of titanium and integrates
                            into
                            the jawbone like a tooth root. This is a process known as osseointegration. The abutment is
                            attached to the post, and the restoration, or crown, is attached to the abutment.

                        </h4>
                        <p class="blog__post">
                            1. Stop your teeth from shifting into the empty space - When you lose a tooth, the
                            surrounding
                            teeth will eventually begin moving to fill in the space. This can cause a number of dental
                            complications. Unevenly spaced or crowded teeth are harder to keep clean and could cost you
                            a
                            fortune down the road in orthodontic care. Placing a dental implant now will keep your teeth
                            properly spaced and make it easy to keep them clean. <br>
                            <br> <br>
                            2. Conserve your jawbone - If you choose to place a fixed bridge instead of getting a dental
                            implant, your jawbone will eventually begin to deteriorate underneath the missing tooth.
                            This
                            occurs because you don’t receive adequate stimulation to the bone without a tooth root. The
                            same
                            occurs with dentures that are not implant-supported. The longer you wait to get dental
                            implants,
                            the more likely it is that your jawbone may lack the integrity to get implants in the future
                            without a dental bone graft. <br>
                            <br><br>
                            3. Implant-supported dentures - Many people complain of a wide variety of complications with
                            their dentures. Poor fit, sores in their mouths, sunken lips, and food restrictions. If you
                            wear
                            dentures, you can get a fixed, permanent solution with implant-supported dentures. There are
                            various procedures available and some even support a full arch of prosthetic teeth with as
                            few
                            as four implants.

                            Implant dentistry has been around for decades. Today it is aided by digital imaging
                            equipment,
                            3D CAD/CAM software, ceramic restoration milling machines, and computer tomography. A
                            dentist
                            with the latest implant dentistry technology at his or her disposal can literally show you
                            your
                            treatment results before ever actually beginning your treatment. If you choose dental
                            implants
                            to replace a tooth, multiple teeth, or provide a more comfortable solution for your
                            dentures,
                            talk to your dentist about your different dental implant treatment options.
