                <div class="homecare_des__right__content">  <p>Let’s start with the obvious: brushing. The act of brushing your teeth removes plaque (bacteria).
                    Plaque is very bad because once it comes in contact with food it produces acid, which creates
                    cavities. You should be brushing at least twice a day. Contrary to popular belief, do not brush your
                    teeth immediately after eating. Wait about 30 minutes because acid in your food softens enamel. If
                    you don’t wait, you risk removing enamel before it hardens again.</p></div>

                            <p>
                                • Add about a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to your brush </p>
                                <p>   • Point the brush at a 45-degree angle against the gum line. Do not push too hard to
                                flatten the bristles. Remember, the tips of the brush clean the teeth </p>
                                <p>   • Begin moving the brush in a small circular motion, and move across each tooth
                                individually. Get in the spaces between the teeth as well as along the gum line </p>
                                <p>   • Repeat the same process for the inside of the teeth against the tongue </p>
                                • For the inside of the front teeth, angle the brush up-and-down, then move your brush </p>
                                in small circles
                                <p>  • Now focus on the tops of the teeth. Your goal is to get into the grooves of the tooth </p>
                                <p>   • You can brush your tongue with your brush, but we do suggest a specialized scraped for
                                that </p>
                                <p>  • Spit, and rinse your mouth out </p>
                                <p>  • And, don’t forget to replace your brush every three to four months! </p>

                                • Floss at least once a day. If you only floss once, do it at night to make sure all
                                food is out before you go to bed.</p>
                                <p>   • Remove a 12-18 inch piece of floss and wrap it around your middle fingers. Leave
                                one-inch of floss to push between teeth</p>
                                <p>    • Using the index fingers to guide, place the floss between your teeth. Don’t push too
                                hard into the gums</p>
                                <p>    • Push the floss up and down. It should make a C-shape around your tooth</p>
                                <p>   • Move the used floss to a new section as needed</p>

                            <p>Our goal with mouthwash is to remove more bacteria. Yes, it does freshen your breath,
                                but it kills bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease.</p>
                                <p>  • Simply swish the wash around your mouth for 30-60 seconds</p>
                                <p>  • You don’t have to gargle if you don’t want to, but it is the fun part </p>

                                • If you feel comfortable using a water pick, please do so. Simply move the pick back to
                                front and going around each tooth individually. Your goal is to get the gum line, top
                                grooves, and in between the teeth clear of anything left behind </p>
                                <p>  • Oils such as eucalyptol, menthol, and tea tree can be swished around the mouth to kelp
                                kill bacteria naturally </p>
                                <p>   • Baking soda cut with water is also a great option for brush cleaning. However, don’t
                                forget to cut it with water or you risk burning your gums

                                <p> • Eat a variety of foods</p>
